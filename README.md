# SubDEX UI - Deprecated

### Installation

The code can be installed using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/subdarkdex/subdex-ui-hackusama.git
cd ./subdex-ui-hackusama
yarn install
```

## Usage

Before you start the frontend locally, you need to start the SubDEX chain node following the [README.md](https://github.com/subdarkdex/subdex-chain).

Then you can start the app in development mode to connect to a locally running node

```bash
yarn start
```

You can also build the app in production mode,

```bash
yarn build
```
and open `build/index.html` in your favorite browser.
